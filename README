This is an extension to the first version of the Ros Android Sensors Driver.
It extends the driver to camera readings and updates the previous version to the post-gradle shift of the rosjava libs.
Two compression methods are currently supported, PNG and JPEG (with selectable compression quality).
The topic names are:

 /android/imu
 /android/fix (GPS)
 /camera/camera_info
 /camera/image/compressed




Compiling:

To compile it on you machine, please follow the detailed instructions at:

Rosjava:
 http://www.dobots.nl/blog/-/blogs/android-and-rosjava

Android OpenCV:
 http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/android_binary_package/android_binary_package.html

Once your environment is set, do the following steps:
 1) git clone the repo in the android_core folder (the same folder where tutorials are).
 2) Edit the settings.gradle file in the android_core folder, adding 'android_sensors_driver' at the end of the include list.
 3) cd android_sensors_driver; ../gradlew clean debug

For the whole process of building, packing, installing into the phone and running the app in debug mode, use the buildAll.sh script.



Known issues:

 1) The code for raw images is also written, although the funcion is currently disabled due to OutOfMemory exceptions and lack of time to debug them. Any help is welcome.
 2) A better UI would be needed, e.g. to set camera parameters (now everything is fixed at 640x480, far focus, ecc.)
